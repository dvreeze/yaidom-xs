 * Low level XML Schema model. The model is at the level of XML schema documents, without resolving any references
 * to definitions and global element and attribute declarations.
 *
 * This model is the closest an XML Schema model can get to an XML Schema model as a direct wrapper of the XML Schema document
 * `Elem` instances. It is both a precise representation of the XML documents and offers "closed" schema document sets.
